<a href="https://github.com/nickpoison"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/NickyPoison-approved-ff69b4.svg?style=flat"></a> 

`astsa` is the R package to accompany the [Springer](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319524511) text, [Time Series Analysis and Its Applications: With R Examples](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/) by Shumway and Stoffer. I won't always push the latest version of the package to CRAN because sometimes it's a pain working with those people.  Consequently, the latest working version of the package will always be here. 
 

* Version 1.8.1 on GitHub
* Version 1.8 on CRAN 
* IF you can read this, then there's no notable difference between the versions. 
* See the [News](https://github.com/nickpoison/astsa/blob/master/NEWS.md) for further details about the state of the package and the changelog.
