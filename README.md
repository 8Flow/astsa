I won't always push the latest version of the package to CRAN because sometimes it's a pain working with those people.  Consequently, the latest working version of the R package to accompany [Time Series Analysis and Its Applications: With R Examples](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/) will always be here.  

* Version 1.7.9 on GitHub
* Version 1.7 on CRAN 
* See the [News](https://github.com/nickpoison/astsa/blob/master/NEWS.md) for further details about the state of the package
